# ProSet Terminal Edition

Working on a Linux machine without a GUI and drooping down wearily because you can't play ProSet? Well droop no more! You can now play ProSet from the command line!

Playing ProSet from the command line is easy! First, build the ProSet executable using your compiler of choice or follow the build instructions at [build/README.md](build/README.md) to build using the provided CMakeLists.txt file.

Once built, you can run ProSet using
```bash
./proset [options]
```

The `proset` executable comes with some built in options:
```
Optional Arguments:
-h              shows help message
-d NUM_DOTS     specify number of dots on each card (between 2 and 8 inclusive)
```

Happy setting!
