# Build Instructions using CMake
First, ensure you have at least version `3.31.5` of CMake.

Then, enter the `build` directory if not already in it and run `cmake ..`.

After this, you should then be able to build the executable using `make` (assuming you haven't configured CMake to use a different build system globally). The `proset` executable will be located in `/build/bin`.
